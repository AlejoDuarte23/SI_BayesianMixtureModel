## Bayesian Modal Updating For System Identification

Implementation of a two-stage fast Bayesian system identification for separated nodes. This repository expands the usage of this technique by adding a mixture model fit to obtain modal parameters from the posterior distribution. This is not a peer reviewed apporach just and implementation that I made during a boring weekend.
